        <h1>About ElliptiKeys</h1>
        <p class="descParagraph">As you could probably tell, this site is based off the ever-popular
            <a href="https://keys.lol" target="blank">keys.lol site.</a> However, this version is capable of deriving 
            every public key type including SegWit and Bech32 addresses, as opposed to only
            Legacy-type addresses. This version also displays all compressed private keys
            alongside uncompressed ones.

            It's also in dark mode.

            To visualize how many private keys there really are and how you will
            never actually find any coins on here, I recommend watching
            this video.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p class="descParagraph">
            Knowing how massive the possible keyspace truly is, storing every single private and public key simply would not be possible.
            The keys are all dynamically computed when the page is loaded. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Since we know a private key is
            simply a number somewhere between 1 and 2^256, it calculates them starting at n=([page number] * [keys/page])
            and derives every private key and its corresponding address formats from n to n + [keys/page].
            Once the private and public keys have been derived, it uses the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/api" target="blank">Blockchain.com API</a>
            to perform the balance checking.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you would like to know more about how this happens behind the scenes, I recommend taking a look
            at <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin-2nd/9781491954379/ch04.html#:~:text=In%20bitcoin%2C%20we%20use%20public,transactions%20to%20spend%20the%20funds." target="blank">this article.</a>
