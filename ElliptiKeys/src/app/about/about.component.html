        <h1>About ElliptiKeys</h1>
        <p class="descParagraph">As you could probably tell, this site is based off the ever-popular
            <a href="https://keys.lol" target="blank">keys.lol site.</a> However, this version is capable of deriving 
            every public key type including SegWit and Bech32 addresses, as opposed to only
            Legacy-type addresses. This version also displays all compressed private keys
            alongside uncompressed ones.

            <br>
            It's also in dark mode.

        <p class="descParagraph">
            To visualize how many private keys there really are and how you will
            never actually find any coins on here, I recommend watching
            this video.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p class="descParagraph">
            Knowing how massive the possible keyspace truly is, storing every single private and public key simply would not be possible.
            The keys are all dynamically computed when the page is loaded. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Since we know a private key is
            simply a number somewhere between 1 and 2^256, it calculates them starting at n=([page number] * [keys/page])
            and derives every private key and its corresponding address formats from n to n + [keys/page].
            Once the private and public keys have been derived, it uses the <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/api" target="blank">Blockchain.com API</a>
            to perform the balance checking. 
            <br>
            <br>
            • Keys that have never been used will turn <span style="color: red;">red.</span> 
            <br>
            • Keys that have been previously used that currently have zero balance will turn <span style="color: yellow;">yellow.</span>
            <br>
            • Keys that currently contain coins will turn <span style="color: lime;">green.</span>
            <br>
            • If you search for a private key, its text on the page will turn <span style="color: cyan;">cyan.</span>

            <br>
